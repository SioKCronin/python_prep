# Python Prep

My aim is to help you identify patterns that show up in the common data structures and algorithms you'll encounter in
technical interviews and on the job as an engineer. We'll look at a variety of algorithms with the goal of spotting 
patterns. When do we use a 'while' loops? When do we use a dictionary vs. a list for memos? What is the overlapping 
subproblem in dynamic programming qeustions? By studying patterns we will prime our minds to spot possible approaches to novel
problems, like a shaman traipsing the woods trains themselves to spot medicinal plants.

This guide assumes you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have tried out some problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have stirred up an authentic curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
the wild, as this is what is needed most to succeed!
