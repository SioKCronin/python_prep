# Python Prep

My goal of this book is to help you identify patterns that show up in the common data structures and algorithms problems
you'll encounter in technical interviews and on the job as an engineer. We'll look at a variety of problems with the goal 
of spotting patterns. When should we use a 'while' loops? When does a dictionary work better than a list as a memo? What 
is the overlapping subproblem in dynamic programming qeustions? By studying patterns we prime our minds to spot 
possible approaches to novel problems, just as a shaman walking the woods trains themselves to spot medicinal plants.

These materials assume you've already learned the basics (strings, lists, dicts, sets, etc.) and have tried out some problems 
on LeetCode or Hackerrank. It also assumes you have stirred up an authentic curiosity about how algorithms behave in 
the wild!
